sudo - sudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified by the security policy. The invoking user's real (not effective) user-ID is used to determine the user name with which to query the security policy.

sudo option can only be used by users who belong to the sudoers group.

For a user to execute a command that requires the sudo prefix, it has to be part of the sudoers group.

To add a user to the sudoers group, run the following command (as root or an account that already has sudo privileges):

usermod -aG sudo [user_name]

For instance, to add the account dharma, you have to type:

sudo usermod -aG sudo dharma

To see a list of accounts that belong to the sudoers group run:

sudo getent group sudo

su - su allows to run commands with a substitute user and group ID. When called without arguments, su defaults to running an interactive shell as root.
